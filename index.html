                    <h1>Trends in Memory Errors</h1>
<p>
This page lists a number of plots that depict trends in discovered memory
errors. We look at both vulnerabilities (extracted from the <a
href="https://nvd.nist.gov/download.cfm#CVE_FEED">CVE data feed</a>) and
exploits (via <a
href="https://github.com/offensive-security/exploit-database">exploit-db</a>).
We classify vulnerabilities and exploits by searching for keywords: issues with
the words <i>php</i>, <i>sql</i>, or <i>xss</i> are said to be
<b>web</b>-related; <b>stack</b>-based vulnerabilities and exploits contain the
words <i>stack-based</i> or <i>stack overflow</i> in their description, for
<b>heap</b>-based ones, we look for <i>heap-based</i>, <i>heap overflow</i>,
<i>use-after-free</i>, and <i>double free</i>; <b>integer</b> issues must
contain the words <i>integer</i>, <i>signedness</i>, or <i>off-by-one</i>; we
identify <b>pointer</b> issues by looking for <i>dereference</i>, and
<i>dangling pointer</i>; issues describing <b>format string</b> issues should
contain the string <i>format string</i>; and finally vulnerabilities and
exploits that contain the word <i>overflow</i> are dubbed as <b>other</b>.
</p>

<p>
Each vulnerability is counted only once in above order, i.e., a format string
issue that allows an attacker to execute sql commands on a remote server is
considered a web vulnerability. This may not always yield honest results, but
it still gives an useful insight in trends in memory-errors.
</p>

<p>
In the top right corner, you can select whether vulnerabilities and exploits
should be processed per 1, 2, or 3 months; using a higher time unit result in
less fluctuations. You can click on a title to show or hide its figure and
description, allowing you to compare graphs with each other easily.

to keep both halves. If you want to know more about memory errors in general,

This figure shows the absolute number of reported memory-error vulnerabilities
per time unit. As of August 2016, it shows a clear linear trend over the period
1997-2007, after which the number of reported issues seems to stabilize to around
60 per month.

This figure shows the relative number of memory-error vulnerabilities and
exploits, subject to the total number of reported vulnerabilities and available
exploits. It shows that since 2006, memory-errors are responsible for 10 to 20%
of all issues, and that exploiting is a bit harder than finding an issue.
Although 2013 may have been the start of a downward trend, recent numbers from
2015 and 2016 indicate that memory errors are back in business, justifying
system security research.

This figure shows the relative number of memory-error <b>and</b> web
vulnerabilities and exploits, subject to their totals. It shows that the
downward trend in the percentage of memory-errors around the year 2003 can
solely be contributed to the rise of the world-wide web. It also shows that over
the last years, web issues seem to become less dominant, resulting in a slight
increase of memory-errors.

This figure shows the number of reported memory-error vulnerabilities,
categorized in stack-based, heap-based, integer, pointer, format string, and
other issues. As expected, it shows that the stack was a popular attack vector
in the early years, while recently the heap has become a more prevalent topic.
This might indicate that stack-based issues are easier to find and solve
automatically (e.g., by compiler extensions), while the heap is still much more
difficult to reason about.

This figure shows the number of reported memory error exploits, categorized in
stack-based, heap-based, integer, pointer, format string, and other issues. It
shows that exploits are slowly catching up with trends in reported
vulnerabilities: up till 2015, the stack was still the most popular attack
vector, while only recently attackers started to look with more detail into heap
attacks. It also shows that format string exploits are basically non-existent.
